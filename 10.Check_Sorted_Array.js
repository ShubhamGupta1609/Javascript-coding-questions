/**Exercise 9: Check if Array is Sorted

Write a function isSorted that takes an array of numbers as input and returns true if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order (i.e., each element is less than or equal to the next element), and false otherwise.

For example:

isSorted([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) should return true.
isSorted([1, 3, 2, 4, 5]) should return false. */
